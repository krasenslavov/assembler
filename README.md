# DOMAssembler

ðŸ§¬ Quickly create HTML DOM structure out of template string (less than 1KB).

## Usage

DOM Assembler is intitive, flexible and easy to use. Take a look the modifiers down the page.

The example below will create an alert message using the Bootstrap framework.

```js
assembler('div.alert.alert-success.mt-3{role:alert}>h4.alert-heading(Well done!)+p(Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.)+hr+p.mb-0(Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.)', '#container');
```

... the above string will create and append the following content into the target `container` element.

```html
<div id="kntbwzhg85q" class="alert alert-success mt-3 ">
	<h4 id="kwl2p59w72p" class="alert-heading ">Well done!</h4>
	<p id="km3896amduho" class="">Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.</p
	><hr id="k4yw3k7ebspl" class="">
